## API Detector Tool
### Objective
The objective of the API Detector tool is to detect leaked APIs, identify, and monitor potential security vulnerabilities related to exposed or unintentionally leaked API keys.

### Key Usage
- **Detection:** Identify instances where API keys have been inadvertently exposed or leaked.
- **Security Hygiene:** Maintain better security hygiene by continuously scanning for leaked API keys.
- **Prevention:** Regular checks help prevent unauthorized access and potential breaches.
- **Validation:** Security researchers and bug bounty hunters use these tools to validate API keys found during security assessments.

### Benefits
- **Risk Reduction:** Detecting and addressing API key leaks promptly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Data Protection:** Protects sensitive data and prevents potential misuse.
- **Exploitation Prevention:** Prevents malicious actors from exploiting leaked keys.
- **Trust Maintenance:** Helps organizations maintain trust with their users and clients.

## Keylogger Tool
### Objective
The primary objective of the keylogger tool is to silently record all keystrokes made on a computer system. It operates covertly, capturing input from the keyboard without the user's knowledge.

### Key Usage
- **Monitoring:** Keyloggers are employed for security purposes to monitor user activity.
- **Forensics:** During digital forensics investigations, keyloggers provide valuable evidence.
- **Analysis:** Investigators analyze keystrokes to reconstruct user actions and identify patterns.
- **Behavior Understanding:** Organizations use keyloggers to understand user behavior.
- **Task Identification:** Analyzing keystrokes aids in identifying common tasks, preferences, and potential risks.

### Benefits
- **Threat Detection:** Keyloggers contribute to early threat detection.
- **Activity Monitoring:** Organizations use keyloggers to monitor employee activities.
- **Password Recovery:** Keyloggers assist in recovering lost or forgotten passwords.
- **Troubleshooting:** Troubleshooters analyze keystrokes to identify issues or errors.
